# Product Requirement Document: Offline ChatOps CLI with LangChain + Local LLM

## Overview

The Offline ChatOps CLI is a Python-based command-line assistant designed for DevOps and Cloud engineers who need to perform system administration tasks through natural language commands. The tool operates entirely offline, leveraging LangChain for natural language processing and local Large Language Models (LLMs) like Ollama with Mistral or LLaMA3 for command interpretation and execution.

This project serves as a comprehensive learning platform for advanced concepts including LangChain integration, local LLM deployment, plugin architecture design, and modern CI/CD practices using GitHub Actions.

## Goals

- **Educational Value**: Provide hands-on experience with LangChain, local LLMs, and modern development practices
- **Extensibility**: Plugin-based architecture allowing custom command extensions
- **Production Quality**: Robust error handling, logging, and automated testing

### Secondary Goals
- **Performance**: Sub-2-second response times for common commands
- **Security**: Secure command execution with validation and sandboxing
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive guides for both usage and development
- **Cross-Platform**: Support for Linux, macOS, and Windows environments
