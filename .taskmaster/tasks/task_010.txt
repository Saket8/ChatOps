# Description: Implement comprehensive configuration system supporting multiple LLM providers, environment variables, and config files
# Details:
Create comprehensive configuration system supporting multiple LLM providers (Groq API, Ollama), environment variables, config files, and provider-specific settings. Implement configuration validation, profiles for different use cases, and advanced configuration features. Include settings for API keys, model selection, provider preferences, and application behavior.

# Test Strategy:
Test configuration loading from environment variables and config files, verify provider-specific validation, test configuration profiles, validate error handling for missing or invalid settings, and ensure backward compatibility with existing configuration.
