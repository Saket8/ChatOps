# Description: Implement persistent interactive chat sessions with command history, context retention, and dual LLM provider support
# Details:
Create persistent interactive chat sessions with command history, context retention, and dual LLM provider support. Implement session state management, command history and replay functionality, special commands (/help, /history, /save), and readline support for command editing. Include OS-aware session context and rich interface with progress indicators.

# Test Strategy:
Test persistent session management, verify command history functionality, test special commands, validate context retention across sessions, and ensure dual LLM provider integration works seamlessly.
