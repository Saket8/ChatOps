# Task ID: 4
# Title: LangChain Integration Layer
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 3
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement LangChain integration for natural language processing with enhanced prompt engineering and multi-provider LLM support
# Details:
Create LangChain components including OS-aware prompt templates for DevOps commands, output parsers for structured responses, and chains for processing user input. Implement enhanced prompt engineering for converting natural language to platform-specific system commands (Windows PowerShell, Linux/macOS Bash). Support multiple LLM providers through provider abstraction layer.

# Test Strategy:
Test prompt templates with sample inputs across different operating systems, verify JSON output parsing, validate command generation accuracy for Windows and Unix platforms, and test provider switching functionality.
