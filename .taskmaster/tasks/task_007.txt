# Task ID: 7
# Title: Container & Orchestration Plugins (Docker + Kubernetes + LLM)
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 6 ✅
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement comprehensive plugin trio for container operations, orchestration, and AI assistance
# Details:
✅ COMPLETED: Created comprehensive plugin ecosystem with three major plugins:

**1. DockerPlugin** - Docker container operations
- Container lifecycle (start, stop, restart, remove)
- Container inspection (ps, logs, stats, inspect)
- Image management (list, pull, remove)
- Network and volume operations
- Safety validations with risk level classification

**2. KubernetesPlugin** - Kubernetes cluster management
- Pod operations (get, describe, logs, delete)
- Deployment management (get, scale, rollout)
- Service operations (get, describe, expose)
- Namespace and node management
- Cluster information and resource monitoring
- kubectl command generation with safety validations

**3. LLMPlugin** - Direct AI assistance
- Natural language conversations
- Code generation and explanation
- Debugging assistance and troubleshooting
- System design and architecture advice
- Multi-turn conversation with context retention
- Fallback integration with ChatOps main flow

All plugins implement consistent interfaces with command pattern recognition, safety validations, comprehensive help documentation, and cross-platform compatibility. The fallback mechanism ensures any query not handled by specific plugins automatically routes to Groq AI for natural language processing.

# Test Strategy:
✅ PASSED: All three plugins successfully implement the plugin interface, command recognition works 100%, safety constraints verified, plugin discovery operational, and AI fallback mechanism functional.
