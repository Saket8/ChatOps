# Task ID: 8
# Title: Command Executor Service
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 4 ✅
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement secure command execution with validation and sandboxing
# Details:
✅ COMPLETED: Created comprehensive command execution service with full security framework:

**CommandExecutor Class:**
- Secure subprocess execution with proper shell handling (PowerShell/Bash)
- Asynchronous execution with timeout controls and resource limits
- Concurrent execution management with configurable limits
- Cross-platform compatibility (Windows/Linux/macOS)

**Security & Validation:**
- CommandValidator with dangerous pattern detection
- Risk-based validation and confirmation requirements
- Command syntax validation and injection prevention
- Safe command whitelisting and dangerous command blocking

**Execution Management:**
- ExecutionContext for configurable execution parameters
- ExecutionResult with comprehensive output and metadata
- Real-time execution status tracking (PENDING/RUNNING/COMPLETED/FAILED/CANCELLED/TIMEOUT)
- Proper process cleanup and resource management

**User Safety Features:**
- Smart confirmation prompts for high-risk operations
- Dry-run mode for command preview without execution
- Interactive confirmation callbacks with detailed command info
- User cancellation support with graceful handling

**Logging & Audit:**
- Comprehensive command history with JSON logging
- Execution metadata tracking (timing, return codes, outputs)
- Configurable log directory and retention
- Memory-based execution history with size limits

**CLI Integration:**
- Full integration with main CLI interface
- Rich progress indicators and status display
- Color-coded execution results and error reporting
- Async execution integration with existing command flow

The service provides enterprise-grade command execution with full audit trails, security validations, and user-friendly interfaces.

# Test Strategy:
✅ PASSED: Import validation successful, security patterns verified, CLI integration complete, async execution functional, and confirmation prompts operational.
